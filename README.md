UB Canaries: A collection of C/C++ programs that detect undefined
behavior exploitation by compilers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Each directory documents and tests an expectation: something a
developer might -- perhaps unreasonably! -- expect the compiler to do
when faced with undefined behavior. For example, the "uninit"
directory tests the expectation that reading an unitialized variable
results in a single arbitrary value.

Each compiler (for a given set of flags) either meets or does not
meet a given expectation.

An expectation may only be tested by looking at a program's stdout,
never by looking at its assembly code or observing its memory usage or
execution time.

Each program must be encapsulated in a single C compilation unit and
should be as sho
