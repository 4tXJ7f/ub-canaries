UB Canaries: A collection of C/C++ programs that detect undefined
behavior exploitation by compilers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each directory documents and tests an expectation: something a developer might
-- perhaps unreasonably! -- expect the compiler to do when faced with undefined
behavior. For example, the "uninitialized-variable" directory tests the
expectation that an uninitialized scalar variable will consistently return some
value that is legal for the variable's type.

If any test program in a directory does not display the expected behavior (for a
given compiler version + flags), then that compiler is considered to violate
that expectation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines for writing tests:

- Each test program should be entirely contained (except for standard header
  files) in a single compilation unit.

- An expectation should only be tested by looking at a program's stdout, never
  by looking at its assembly code or observing its memory usage or execution
  time. Each program should have at most a few outputs corresponding to the
  expected case; and other output should be considered unexpected.
